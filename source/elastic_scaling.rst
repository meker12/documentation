How can I add a data node?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new instance comes with two data nodes and more can be easily added after the initial instance creation. To add more nodes go to the Elasticsearch instance in the Control Panel and simply click the **Data Nodes** heading, then the  **Add Data Node** button and follow the prompts. Additional charges apply, so take a look at our `pricing <http://objectrocket.com/pricing>`_ page for details.

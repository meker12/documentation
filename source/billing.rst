What is "tiered pricing"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tiered pricing is a way to save money as your data grows on the platform. It’s a graduated tier structure that means your price per GB goes down the bigger our footprint is. 

Here's a link to our `pricing calculator <http://objectrocket.com/pricing>`_, which shows the costs for each tier.

Why is ObjectRocket for MongoDB billed using a tiered model, but other ObjectRocket solutions are not?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are working to provide tiered pricing for all of our products, but in the meantime feel free to reach out to our `sales team <mailto:sales@objectrocket.com>`_ if you’d like to learn how pricing scales as you grow.

Why do I have multiple ObjectRocket charges on different dates during the month? When will I be billed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each database technology has its own subscription with its own anniversary date. The anniversary date is the date that you created an instance or the instance came out of its trial. For example, if you have a Mongo instance created on the 5th and a Redis instance created on the 12th, you will have two different subscriptions that are billed on those dates for each product. This isn't per instance, but rather technology, so your MongoDB instances are billed on that first anniversary date, and then your Redis instances on the other.

I was billed up front, so what happens if I increase or reduce my footprint before my next bill?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ObjectRocket is a subscription based service that bills in advance. The subscription rate is based on the footprint that exists at the time of the transaction. 

Because ObjectRocket subscriptions are billed a month in advance, any increases or decreases in usage are added as prorated adjustments on the next bill. 

For example: if you are charged for 10GB on the first of the month, but reduce your footprint to 5GB, you will receive a prorated credit. If instead you raise your footprint to 15GB, you will receive a prorated charge for the increase on your next anniversary date.

What happens if I delete my instance and start a new one, will I be billed in advance for that instance again?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you delete an instance and the create a new one within the same billing period, it will be added to the same subscription with the appropriate prorated charges. If the addition of a new instance takes after the end of the billing period in which your first instance was deleted, a new subscription will be created, for which you will be billed in advance.


What types of credit cards do you accept?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.

What happens if my credit card is declined?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your credit card issuer declines the transaction, or the credit card is expired or otherwise isn't allowing the transaction to go through, you will receive emails asking you to update your credit card information. 

.. note::

 After approximately 30 days we have not received payment, access to your data will be removed.

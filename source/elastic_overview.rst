Elasticsearch Overview
=======================

What is Elasticsearch?
----------------------

Elastic.co defines Elasticsearch as a distributed, open source search and analytics engine, designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and easy management. It combines the speed of search with the power of analytics via a sophisticated, developer-friendly query language covering structured, unstructured, and time-series data.

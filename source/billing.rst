When will I be billed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ObjectRocket bills for instance subscription one month in advance. When a change to
your set of instances occurs, an invoice is generated with the prorated increased or decreased amount. That invoice amount is added to your next billing cycle creating an bill for the prorated increase or decrease, plus next months subscription.  Changes can occur when you manually add
instances or shards from our website, or automatically when RocketScaleâ„¢
adds shards to an instance.

If you reduce your usage but continue to use your account, we'll apply any
credit toward your next bill.


What kinds of payment do you accept?

We accept Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Diners Club, JCB.

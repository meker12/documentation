What is Elasticsearch?
----------------------

Per Wikipedia: Elasticsearch is a search server based on `Lucene`_. It provides a distributed, `multitenant`_-capable full-text search engine with a `RESTful`_ web interface and schema-free `JSON`_ documents. Elasticsearch is developed in `Java`_ and is released as `open source`_ under the terms of the `Apache License`_. Elasticsearch is the second most popular enterprise search engine. 

Per Elastic, Elasticsearch's parent company, they define it as so: Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time.

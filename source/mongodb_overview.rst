MongoDB Overview
================

ObjectRocket offers different products now, but our original was MongoDB as a Service. Our MongoDB infrastructure has been specifically designed to be scalable, performant, highly available, and most of all easy to use!

We offer easy provisioning through our Control Panel and once created can be accessed through any of the standard MongoDB connection methods using a connect string unique to that instance. We define an instance on our platform as a highly available cluster, which can have multiple databases underneath. You'd manage each instance as a whole, with it's own connect string and ACL's, as well as individual databases and collections inside.

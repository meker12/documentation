Getting Started Guide
=====================

This guide is designed to help understand how to get up and running on the ObjectRocket platform quickly and easily. There are just a few steps necessary to be up and running with a brand new instance. This guide assumes you're using the ObjectRocket `dashboard <https://app.objectrocket.com/>`_.

Here are the high level steps:

1. Create an ObjectRocket account
2. Add billing info
3. Create an instance
4. Create a database
5. Add an ACL
6. Connect!

1. Create an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obtaining an ObjectRocket account is as simple as `signing up here <https://app.objectrocket.com/sign_up>`_ and completing the forms listed. Enter your account information, all fields are required. ObjectRocket utilizes a single login for now, but we're working on adding functionality for sub-accounts. For now we recommend using a mailing list if you need access for multiple people, eg. devops@mycompany.com.

Once complete, click 'Launch my account'.

2. Add billing info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can create an instance, you'll need to add your billing information. You can do so from the default landing page by clicking 'add a credit card to your account', or by clicking your username on the upper right, clicking 'Billing Information', then clicking the 'Set Credit Card' button on the left side.

3. Create an instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we offer both MongoDB and Redis, there are two guides for getting started with each: `MongoDB <http://docs.objectrocket.com/getting_started_mongo.html>`_ and `Redis <http://docs.objectrocket.com/getting_started_redis.html>`_

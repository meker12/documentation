Elasticsearch Overview
=======================

What is Elasticsearch?
----------------------

Elastic.co defines Elasticsearch as a distributed, open source search and analytics engine, designed for horizontal scalability, reliability, and easy management. It combines the speed of search with the power of analytics via a sophisticated, developer-friendly query language covering structured, unstructured, and time-series data.

What does ObjectRocket Elasticsearch provide?
---------------------------------------------

Starting with many NoSQL data stores like Elasticsearch is easy, but daily administration, monitoring, backups, and scaling can add a heavy and challenging workload to already overtaxed teams. We take the operational burden off of your team with our purpose built platform and 24/7/365 Fanatical Support so you can focus on using Elasticsearch and not keeping it up and running.

When you build an ObjectRocket Elasticsearch instance, you get a cluster with a total of 11 nodes. We automatically configure 4 front-end client nodes, 2 Kibana nodes, 3 master nodes, and 2 data nodes. This robust setup is ready to handle the load and scale of your most mission critical workloads.

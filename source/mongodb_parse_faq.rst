Parse Migration FAQ
===================

Why migrate from Parse?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On January 28th 2016 Parse announced they'd be shutting down their service, leaving quite a few customers questioning where they'd be moving. Luckily we've worked closely with Parse on creating a MongoDB instance on our platform in several different sizes to fit any Parse customers needs.

With their help we're able to transition any current customer from their platform to ours, and our support is ready to jump in if you have any questions about the process.

.. note::
    
    Until March 31st 2016, the first Parse instance you create will have 15% off for a full year. Sign up `here <https://objectrocket.com/parse>`_!
